# Hello, I'm Paul ü§†
I am a computer science student at the Silesian University of Technology, approaching my last semester. I have been programming for a few years and am still eager to learn more about computer architecture - memory, CPUs, GPUs, and a lot of other low-level things. I value my sense for memory management, performance, data structures and solid foundations.

# My projects üìù
## Solo Graphics / Game development
I am most passionate about 3D programming, for now I am using only OpenGL (I plan to learn Vulkan eventually) as my API of choice. I also enjoy programming anything to do with graphics, 3D or 2D, also using libraries (or __a__ library - [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML)).
Using those I have made many projects over the years (especially SFML, I used it a lot when I was still learning a lot of basic things, hence not everything is here / I won't highlight every):

 - [Solar System Simulator and Editor](https://github.com/KomorXD/SolarSystemSim) (in the making, my engineering thesis)
 - [Arcade Survival - 2D shoot'em up arena](https://github.com/KomorXD/ArcadeSurvival) (university project)
 - [Game of Life](https://github.com/KomorXD/Game-of-Life-OpenGL)

## University projects / assignments
For most of my university projects I have been working with a team of my colleagues, utilizing various tools and methods to make our workflow as smooth as possible (thanks to a common team manager), those being mainly managed GitHub repos, Kanban, SCRUM-like meetings and specifying roles for each team member.
Those projects are:

 - [Lethal Speed - 3D movement oriented FPS game, inspired by Ghostrunner](https://github.com/szejkerek/LethalSpeed)
 - [Tabulator - C# WPF app for managing storage items across faculties and departments](https://github.com/KomorXD/tabulator)
 - [Workout Tracker (servers down) - SvelteKit app for tracking workout combined with social aspects](https://github.com/szejkerek/WorkoutTracker)
 - [AI Image Segmentation training script](https://github.com/KomorXD/bijaj)
 - [BrainScan - reading and displaying NiFtI image scans, making annotations and applying masks](https://github.com/KomorXD/BrainScan)
# My tech stack üìö
My tech stack mainly consists of:
 - C/C++ (with CMake)
 - OpenGL
 - Python
 - JavaScript/TypeScript
 - C#
 - Also learning: Rust
    
I also am capable of quickly learning new skills / technologies, which makes me very flexible in case of any changes/opportunities.
